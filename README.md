# froxlor-installer
Bash install script to install latest version of froxlor including all required system components.

## Installation
Login to your machine, open terminal (**ssh/shell**) and run the following command **as root**:  
`# wget -O froxlor-install.bash https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TimoStramann/froxlor-installer/master/froxlor-install.bash && chmod +x froxlor-install.bash && ./froxlor-install.bash`  

When the installation has finished open your webbrowser and finish the installation there. Return to your terminal/ssh session when you finished online installation and continue.  
After the second part of the script finished reboot your machine to make sure all changes are applied properly (especially quotas).

## Update
Not yet supported unfortunately. :/
